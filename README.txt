FoosRPI
=======

FoosRPI aims to put a computer inside a foosball table to record data from games, send it to an online database, 
and display it on a website in the form of a leaderboard. 
People sign up with their RPI ISO idâ€™s on the website, and start a game by flashing their id cards on RFID readers on the 
side of the table.
